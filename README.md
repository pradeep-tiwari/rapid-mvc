# rapid-mvc
Beginner friendly mvc based PHP framework.

# Convention
It uses /controller/method/param1/parm2/... based URL conventions to map requests to corresponding controller files based on an autoloader. By no way it is meant to be used at production level without fully understanding the security concerns of web applications.

# Hack for fun
This framework implements a basic request dispatcher, request mapper, and few conventions to perform little magic. It is great for the purpose of learning the basics of an mvc structure based project wired using PHP.
